        <p class="lead">Biology offers many capabilities that could address the global challenges we face as a society. The Biocompute Lab is attempting to understand how to effectively reprogram biology to co-opt and install new functionalities into living systems across scales; from networks of interacting molecules, to cellular collectives, and even entire ecosystems.</p>
