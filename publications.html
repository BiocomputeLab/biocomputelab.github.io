        From individual cells deciding how to differentiate during development,
        to socail insects coordinating their actions when scavenging for food;
        the ability to perform complex computations and process information
        enables life.

        The Biocompute Lab explores the molecular-scale mechanisms that
        individual cells and groups of cells use to make sense of their world.
        We apply tools and methods from the field of synthetic biology to create
        new living systems from the ground-up. By studying these artificial
        systems using novel techniques we are developing based on sequencing,
        microfluidics and computational modelling, we aim to better understand
        the rules governing how biological parts are best pieced together to
        perform useful computations. Understanding the computational
        architecture of cells opens new ways of reprogramming them to tackle
        problems spanning the sustainable production of materials to novel
        therapeutics. It also provides key insights into how biology controls
        the complex processes and structures sustaining life.
