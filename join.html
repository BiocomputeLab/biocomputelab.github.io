      <h3>Rewiring ant communication using engineered bacteria</h3>
      <p>Social insects such as ants make extensive use of chemical signals deposited into their environment as a means to coordinate collective colony-level behaviours that go far beyond the capabilities of each individual. This indirect communication process, known as stigmergy, has been shown to underpin the ability for ants to efficiently forage for food, build and repair complex nests, and assess the suitability of new nest sites. Over the past few decades our understanding of the biochemical composition of these signals has substantially increased. However, difficulties in producing these molecules using standard approaches with chemistry has hindered the ability to effectively study their role and function.</p>
      <p>The aim of this project is to give researchers the ability to "talk" to ants using their own chemical signals using new, synthetic biology approaches for bio-compound production. This will allow for a better understanding of the rules ants use to generate emergent collective behaviours by allowing the communications within these systems to be perturbed in precise and controllable ways. Such knowledge would not only offer new insight into how our own societies might be better organised (e.g. to reduce the spread of disease), but also offers a means to develop interventions that can disrupt the functioning of a colony as an avenue towards novel, non-destructive pest control methods.</p>

      <h3>Controlling chromosome conformation and content as a step towards synthetic cellular differentiation</h3>
      <p>Synthetic biology aims to apply engineering principles to biology to allow us to create novel living systems with our own desired behaviours. In this project, the student will explore the engineering of a fundamental component of all living cells – their genome. Rather than considering it as a constant stable entity, the student will make use of molecular machines able to recognise specific sequences in DNA and carry out structural rearrangements of its content. This will allow for the programmable removal and/or restructuring of genetic information with the goal of drastically altering cellular behaviour. Such cells could then be used to many different contexts, for example, differentiating into many specialised forms to optimise the production of value chemicals in bioreactors through a division of labour.</p>
      <p>This project offers a new perspective on the emerging field of synthetic genomics by exploiting existing molecular machines to carry out the dynamic rearrangement and modification genetic material in living cells. It brings together a broad range of cutting-edge bioengineering methodologies and techniques and will provide insight into the role of chromosome conformation in gene regulation and overall cellular function.</p>

      <h3>Engineering orthogonal ribosomes as a platform for programmable protein modification</h3>
      <p>Proteins act as the core molecular machines within living cells and underpin crucial tasks spanning the coordination of metabolism to the self-assembly of structural cytoskeletal components. Many of these diverse functions can be tailored by post-translational modifications of the protein involved (e.g. myristoylation is known to be used for the dynamic control of membrane targeting and protein-protein interactions). However, ensuring that a desired set of modifications is applied to a specific protein of interest is challenging as they often occur post-translationally making their targeting difficult.</p>
      <p>To overcome this issue, in this EPSRC-funded project the student will develop orthogonal ribosomes that can be targeted to specific messenger RNAs not recognized by the host cell and allow for the attachment of engineered enzymes that can support the modification of nascent protein chains as translation occurs. To engineer the orthogonal ribosomes the student will employ high-throughput screening approaches using nanopore sequencing to understand the design constraints of the ribosome, and modifying enzyme attachments will be rationally designed using a new protein design tool called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847717301417?via%3Dihub">Elfin</a>. This project is a rare opportunity to work on emerging technologies for accelerated genetic design with the <a hre="https://biocomputelab.github.io">Biocompute Lab</a> (<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=q18IlDoAAAAJ&hl=en">Thomas Gorochowski</a>) and next-generation protein engineering tools with the Protein Design Lab (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_IjSxWMAAAAJ&hl=en">Fabio Parmeggiani</a>), as well as join the vibrant <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/institutes/biodesign/">biodesign community</a> at the University of Bristol.</p>
      <p>The online application form will soon go live, but in the meantime, if you would like to learn more about the project please contact Thomas Gorochowski (<a href="mailto:thomas.gorochowski@bristol.ac.uk">thomas.gorochowski@bristol.ac.uk</a>).
