          <h4>Towards a robust and reproducible cell-free synthetic biology</h4>
          <h5>BBSRC CASE PhD Studentship</h5>
          <p>An area of synthetic biology that has seen significant growth in recent years is the use of cell-free expression systems. These are made by extracting the contents of living cells such that all the machinery needed to execute our own biological programs is available and can be carefully controlled. The major advantage of using a cell-free system is that it doesn’t require the slow process of growing cells and so enables the rapid testing of new biological systems in a test tube. It also offers the possibility of blending the capabilities of many different organisms by mixing extracts from multiple types of cell. Although cell-free systems speed-up development of synthetic biological systems, their use is hampered by difficulties in reliably producing cell extracts that have similar performance. The processes of extracting the contents of cells is highly variable and no methods exist to fully understand how well a particular extract is working.</p>
          <p>This project aims to tackle these problems and support the robust scale-up of cell-free synthetic biology. In collaboration with Cell-Free Technologies, a start-up focused on the use of cell-free systems to accelerate synthetic biology, the project will explore different ways that living cells can be grown to improve the reproducibility of the extracts produced. In parallel, a large number of biological programs encoded in DNA will be constructed and used to test how well different extracts work. To measure the performance of each extract, recently developed sequencing methods will be used that allow us to peer into the inner workings of these systems and precisely understand how well our biological programs function. The project offers the opportunity to learn a broad range of interdisciplinary skills covering new bioengineering approaches and novel sequencing methods, as well as connections and exposure to the ways of working and needs of industry.</p>
          <p>Supervisory team: Dr Thomas Gorochowski (Biological Sciences), Dr Ross Anderson (Biochemistry), Dr Thomas Meany (CEO, Cell-Free Technology). This PhD studentship is offered as part of the SWBio Doctoral Training Programme, see <a href="http://www.swbio.ac.uk/">http://www.swbio.ac.uk</a> for further details.</p>
