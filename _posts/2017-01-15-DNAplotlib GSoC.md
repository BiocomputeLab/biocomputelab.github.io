Are you interested in programming and open-source projects? Want to know what it is like to work on a real research project? Well, this year the Biocompute Lab has joined the global Google Summer of Code (GSoC) scheme that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects. Our project will focus on improvements to genetic circuit visualisation tool called DNAplotlib to enable the visual display of complex biological designs and development of the next-generation of rendering pipeline to support exciting future directions. Successful students will be mentored by Thomas Gorochowski (Biocompute Lab, University of Bristol, UK) and Bryan Bartley (University of Washington, USA). For more details about the scheme and how to apply check out the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) GSoC page: [http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc.html](http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc.html), and for specific information about our project check out: [DNAplotlib GSoC Project](https://github.com/nrnb/GoogleSummerOfCode/issues/74)
