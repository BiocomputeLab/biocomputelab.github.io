# Engineering + Biology = A Sustainable Future?
## Biology as a Technology
The emerging field of synthetic biology aims to bring the principles of engineering to living systems through standardisation, abstraction, modelling and design, coupled with foundational technologies such as DNA synthesis [1]. Supporting this approach has been what are termed standard biological parts. In the same way that electrical engineers use catalogues to find suitable electronic components, initiatives such as the Registry of Standard Biological Parts [2] and the BioFAB [3] attempt to provide a curated library of DNA sequences that can be pieced together in new yet predictable ways. This allows for engineers to abstract some of the biological details and focus on larger more complex designs [4]. Although this radical idea was originally met with scepticism, researchers have successfully built synthetic biological circuits that act as toggle switches, oscillators and pulse generators in living cells. Furthermore, by connecting circuits like these to existing cellular functions, powerful systems can be built. In this way bacteria have been engineered to act as cheap, but highly sensitive, biosensors for dangerous chemicals in water supplies [5] and reprogrammed to hunt down, infect and kill cancerous tissue [6].

Even though synthetic biology offers new solutions to many pressing problems, care must be taken when treating it as an established technology. The complexity of living systems makes predictable design challenging and there will always be the chance of exploitation for harmful applications. With this in mind, to date the community has placed regulatory and ethical issues at the forefront to ensure a healthy dialogue with policy makers and the wider public. Robert Carlson argues, if sufficient measures are put in place the benefits that synthetic biology may offer far outweighs the current risks [7]. Therefore, it would be naive to hinder use of this powerful technology especially considering the current environmental challenges being faced.

## Sustainable Manufacture with Synthetic Biology
The ability of biological systems to safely recycle waste biomass and transform it into useful chemicals and materials offers a huge opportunity to develop more sustainable methods of manufacture. In the same way that microbes have been used to produce beer for centuries, synthetic biology is now enabling these organisms to be reprogrammed for generating precursors to bio-based plastics through fermentation [8]. This provides a first step towards far more ambitious plans of several architects to use synthetic biology for automated large-scale construction of humanly designed biological materials and objects.

Rachel Armstrong from the School of Architecture & Construction, University of Greenwich, London is re-imagining how future cities might be built, or grown, from the ground up [9]. She envisages buildings not as static entities, but as living objects that can change due to seasonal cycles, optimise their design over time and autonomously carry out repairs after damage. From a sustainability perspective, she highlights that by building with biological materials we could see a reversal in urban areas being vast consumers of natural resources, to one where they are centres of energy and material production. This is all made possible by the ability to harness biological characteristics in new and novel ways.

A major difficulty when applying existing design tools to biological systems is the tiny size of their cellular building blocks. For synthetic biology to offer a useful medium for construction there needs to be ways of traversing length-scales from microns to metres. To do this David Benjamin of The Living Lab at Columbia University, New York is developing novel workflows that blend traditional design tools with new computational models of pattern formation in bacterial populations [10]. This allows for collective features of cells to bridge the gap and produce living and intelligent materials with features at scales useful for architecture. Although at an early stage, it is clear that embracing alternative and new design methods will be essential to the successful and efficient engineering of biological systems like these.

## A Bright Future?
The transformational applications that synthetic biology offers, from the green production of chemicals and materials to fundamentally new approaches in medicine, has lead to a surge of interest and funding over the past decade. Major research councils see synthetic biology as a crucial future technology and have proposed large support for building capability within the UK [11]. Even so, current progress has been slower than many had predicted and there is a real danger that the field may over state the contributions it can make in the near to medium term future [12]. To ensure this is not the case young engineers must step up to the challenge. They need to adopt a new mindset and tackle the major hurdles of working with living cells by developing methods that can both control and harness the multi-level, unpredictable and dynamic nature of these systems. This is very different to the well behaved and predictable materials they are used to, but biology offers many compelling advantages including an ability to adapt to changing environments and most importantly sustainability.

Engineering has overcome many challenges during the last century and I am optimistic that it can rise to the demands of a sustainable future. Maybe one day a chair from IKEA won't result in the stressful battle of piecing together the various parts, but instead be the result of synthetic biology requiring just a little water, food and time to grow. Sounds like bliss.
