# Homeostasis, part I: keeping the status quo is not always simple
by Thomas Gorochowski

I'm sure many of us have had that frustrating moment in a hotel when after barely waking up we are confronted with the separated hot and cold taps of a foreign shower system. Your challenge if you choose to accept it is to maintain a flow of warm water that neither induces hypothermia nor melts your skin - for an engineer easy, surely?

If you are anything like me then these scenarios often end up in what seems like some form of spa treatment with jets of water continually fluctuating from freezing cold to boiling hot and the controls seemly having a mind of their own! This type of challenge is commonly faced in engineering and is an example of homeostasis — regulation of a system such that internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant [1]. This is exactly the problem that devices such as thermostats aim to solve monitoring and adjusting the heating of a room to maintain a constant temperature. In fact, engineering has developed an entire field that encompasses such goals (and more) called control theory, which provides a mathematical basis for designing ‘controllers’ and feedback laws that ensure stability and safely control the behaviour of a system. Check out the following YouTube channel to see the broad range of topics this covers [2].

While the shower example earlier was not a matter of life or death, for the building blocks of life — cells — ensuring homeostasis really is. The biochemistry that takes place within a cell to power the processes of life relies on a carefully controlled internal environment that maintains specific pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, and many other properties within specific ranges. Even though the external environment may change, the cell must be capable of sensing and modulating its behaviour to shield its inner workings. The video below shows what happens when this goes wrong. Specifically, a change in osmolarity causes increased pressure within the cell that leads to it ultimately bursting [3].

Thankfully, over billions of years evolution has created and honed a range of molecular controllers to ensure such disasters don’t occur and there is growing realisation that engineers can learn a lot from the solutions that biology has developed to tackle some of the challenging problems we face today. This is not a one way street though. Over the past decade ideas from control theory have also given us new insight into _why_ biological systems are structured in particular ways and provided understanding as to their limits [4].

Over the next few months we will present a series of articles that will investigate some of the ways that cells maintain their homeostasis and some of the potential links to engineered systems we are more familiar with. We will explore the variety of stresses faced by cells, explain the ingenious ways they sense their internal and external environments, and the molecular nano-scale machines they use to control homeostasis. In addition, interviews with researchers at the forefront of this field and a range of students studying these topics will give personal insight into the challenges and some of the exciting opportunities it opens, spanning new forms of antibiotics to novel approaches for engineering robust living systems. We will end by looking at some of the broader implications of this phenomenon, asking whether there are shared attributes from the biochemistry of cells, to the behaviours of entire human societies. We hope this will give you a new perspective to biology and show how similar many of the problems engineers face are to those in very different fields.

The work discussed in this series forms part of a larger European Marie-Curie Actions [5] Initial Training Network (ITN) called NICHE that attempts to investigate many aspects of cellular homeostasis. For more information check out the project website at: http://http://www.uni-potsdam.de/niche/
