Vittorio Bartoli and Ana Rubio Denniss have been awarded BrisSynBio-MaxSynBio researcher exchange awards to support short-term placements for building links between the UK and German synthetic biology networks. Vittorio will be visiting the <a href="http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/Biomicrofluidic_Systems">Biomicrofluidics Systems Group</a> headed by Dr Tom Robinson at the <a href="http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/en">Max Planck Intitute of Colloids and Interfaces</a> in Berlin, Germany. He will be exploring the creation of novel microfluidic devices to enable a better scale-up of synthetic biology processes for industrial production. Ana will be travelling to the <a href="http://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/4436512/MaxSynBio_Research_Group">Light-controlled Systems Group</a> headed by Dr Seraphine Wegner at the <a href="http://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/home/en">Max Planck Intitute for Polymer Research</a>, Mainz, Germany. She will be working to investigate how photo-switchable proteins can be used to control nanoparticle swarms. Placements are scheduled to take place in the Autumn.
