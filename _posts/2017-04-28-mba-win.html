Daniel Dixon and Vittorio Bartoli, along with their team Accellarus, we awarded second place in a Dragon's Den style competition, winning Â£2,000 of lab space and services by pitching a start-up business idea to investors. The competition came at the end of a 4-day course on building a synthetic biology-rich biotech business held by <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/brissynbio/">BrisSynBio</a> and <a href="http://www.synbicite.com/news-events/2017/may/11/brissynbios-competition-winners-announced/">SynbiCITE</a>. The company, Accellarus aims to accelerate the commercialisation of biosynthetic pathways using it's designer chassis organism, the world's first organism whose ecological niche is an industrial bioprocess.
