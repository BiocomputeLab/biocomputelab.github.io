Vittorio Bartoli and Ana Rubio Denniss have been awarded BrisSynBio-MaxSynBio researcher exchange awards to support short-term placements for building links between the UK and German synthetic biology networks. Vittorio will be visiting the [Biomicrofluidics Systems Group](http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/Biomicrofluidic_Systems) headed by Dr Tom Robinson at the [Max Planck Intitute of Colloids and Interfaces](http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/en) in Berlin, Germany. He will be exploring the creation of novel microfluidic devices to enable a better scale-up of synthetic biology processes for industrial production. Ana will be travelling to the [Light-controlled Systems Group](http://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/4436512/MaxSynBio_Research_Group) headed by Dr Seraphine Wegner at the Max Planck Intitute for Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany. She will be working to investigate how photo-switchable proteins can be used to control nanoparticle swarms. Placements are scheduled to take place in the Autumn.
