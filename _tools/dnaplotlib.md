DNAplotlib enables highly customizable visualization of individual genetic constructs and libraries of design variants. It can be thought of in many ways as matplotlib for genetic diagrams. DNAplotlib is capable of SBOL Visual compliant diagrams in addition to a format able to better illustrate the precise location and length of each genetic part.
