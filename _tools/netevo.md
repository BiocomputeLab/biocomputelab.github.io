description: NetEvo is a computing framework and collection of end-user tools designed to allow researchers to investigate evolutionary aspects of dynamical complex networks. By providing tools to easily integrate each of these factors in a coherent way, it aims to explore how they lead to the emergent properties displayed by many complex systems.
