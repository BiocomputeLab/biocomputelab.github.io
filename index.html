        The Biocompute Lab explores the molecular-scale mechanisms that
        individual cells and groups of cells use to make sense of their world.
        We apply tools and methods from the field of synthetic biology to create
        new living systems from the ground-up. By studying these artificial
        systems using novel techniques we are developing based on sequencing,
        microfluidics and computational modelling, we aim to better understand
        the rules governing how biological parts are best pieced together to
        perform useful computations. Understanding the computational
        architecture of cells opens new ways of reprogramming them to tackle
        problems spanning the sustainable production of materials to novel
        therapeutics. It also provides key insights into how biology controls
        the complex processes and structures sustaining life.

            <h3>Reprogramming biology</h3>
            <p>Biology offers many capabilities that could address the global challenges we face as a society. The Biocompute Lab is attempting to understand how to effectively reprogram biology to co-opt and install new functionalities into living systems across scales; from networks of interacting molecules, to cellular collectives, and even entire ecosystems.</p>

            <h3>Advanced cellular analytics</h3>
            <p>Inside every cell is a complex, dynamic and sometimes mysterious environment. The Biocompute Lab is developing advanced biometrology approaches based on emerging technologies like nanopore sequencing and high-throughput fluorescence activate cell sorting to "see" and "measure" the inner workings of this typically hidden world.</p>

            <h3>Engineering (with) evolution</h3>
            <p>Evolution is the most powerful creative force on this planet. The Biocompute Lab is exploring ways to harness and integrate evolution into new biological design workflows, as well as searching for avenues to engineer evolutionary processes themselves to create a new generation of truly self-adaptive engineered living system.</p>
