I am an MSc Bioinformatics student at the University of Bristol with a background in Biomedical science and computing. In particular, I am interested in the processing and analysis of RNA and DNA sequences especially in the context of gene expression. My project is based around developing a bioinformatics pipeline for processing direct RNA and cDNA nanopore sequence data.
