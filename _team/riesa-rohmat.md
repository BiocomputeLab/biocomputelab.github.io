I am a first year PhD student funded by LPDP scholarship from Indonesian government and a proud mom of two amazing son. My work will be focused on Adaptable genetic circuits for on-the-fly optimization of engineered biological processes. A combination of existing tuneable genetic parts and genome editing technologies will be used in conjunction with project-developed computational models to provide a foundation for more flexible engineered cells.
