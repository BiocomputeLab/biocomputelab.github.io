Research Associate in Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol with a background in Metabolic engineering and Protein purification. I completed my Ph.D. in Metabolic engineering at the University of Nottingham in 2019, and previously an MSc in Biotechnology at The University of Granada, Spain. I currently base my research on the design and implementation of genetic circuits to improve the understanding of gene regulation in metabolic pathways of E. coli and yeast. My research tries to discover new tools within synthetic biology and make those already implemented more feasible and reliable for biotechnology purposes.
