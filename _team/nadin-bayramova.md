I am currently an integrated masters (MSci) Biology student at the University of Bristol. By being introduced to synthetic biology during my degree and by previously undertaking a research internship at SLCU, I have developed a keen interest in plant bioengineering, novel biotechnology, and utilising directed evolution to optimise biological systems. During my time with the Biocompute lab I will be gaining experience working in the field of synthetic biology and exploring different avenues of research, as I plan to pursue a PhD in the future.
