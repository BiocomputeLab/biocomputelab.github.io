With the generous support of an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship Award from the the University of Bristol, it was a pleasure to host the inaugural Synthetic Biology Meets Robotics event at Bristol Aquarium. We had an action packed schedule of talks, networking, posters, exhibits, ideas generation and prizes! As with all good events, it ended with a drink admiring Brunel's wonderful bridge.
