2nd year master student visiting the lab for a research project on ribosomes in collaboration with Eszter Cisbra (Imperial College London). Trying to use structure and sequence-based rational design approaches to modify the ribosome and understand the principles governing altered translation. I learned about synthetic biology through iGEM in 2018 and worked in molecular biology ever since. I worked on sRNA-based genetic circuits for implementation of RNA based logic in bacteria as well as mRNA and tRNA-based therapeutics in human cell culture during my time in the Ignatova Lab. Additionally, I have a background in structural biology doing cryo-EM of ribosomes and x-ray-crystallography of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins. For my master thesis I will work on serial crystallography of SARS-CoV-2 methyltransferases (mRNA processing) in the Chapman Lab at the CFEL, DESY. Currently I plan to do my PhD afterwards hopefully on a topic somewhere in between synthetic, RNA and structural biology.
