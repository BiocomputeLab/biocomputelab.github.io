I am investigating the use of a targeted nanopore sequencing approach using CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment for fast and reliable nematode species identification. Nematodes are indicators of environmental health, and high-throughput techniques allow identification of a greater number of individuals from environmental samples compared to laborious morphological methods. My method uses the principle of 'metabarcoding'; sequencing a marker gene for identification of multiple species in a sample. Current methods rely on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of a marker gene prior to sequencing which can introduce significant bias, skewing abundance estimates of the species present. Targeted nanopore sequencing using CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment does not require amplification, thus has the potential to remove amplification-associated bias from the process.
