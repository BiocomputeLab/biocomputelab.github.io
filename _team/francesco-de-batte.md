My PhD research is co-supervised by Tiffany Taylor and Thomas Gorochowski, who have expertise in evolutionary microbiology and synthetic biology respectively. During my undergraduate studies (BA and MSci Natural Sciences) at the University of Cambridge, I enjoyed getting involved in the Synthetic Biology Society and learning about evolutionary theory. I’m excited to spend the next 3.5 years of my life exploring the interface of synthetic biology and evolution, trying to use synthetic biology to test evolutionary hypotheses and to use our understanding of evolution to inform the design of predictably evolvable living systems.
