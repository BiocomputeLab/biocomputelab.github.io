I am a specialist technician working in the Biocompute Lab to increase throughput of experiments using automation. Here, I am working with the Opentrons OT-2 liquid handling robot with an aim to establish it within the lab to manage and complete routine protocols as accurately and as fast as possible.

My previous experience in automation has included the use of Tecan, Perkin Elmer and Agilent liquid handlers and Thermo Fisher’s integrated laboratory automation platforms and software ‘Momentum’.
