I am a PhD student part of the BBSRC/EPSRC [Engineering Biology CDT](https://engbio-cdt.org/). My general research interest lie in the intersection of synthetic biology and machine learning. Some other areas that I find fascinating are biocomputing, gene circuit design, mathematical modelling and sequencing/synthesis technologies. I hope that my research will bring some real-world applications with a positive impact for society.
