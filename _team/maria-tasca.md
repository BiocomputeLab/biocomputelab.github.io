I am a PhD student in the Engineering Biology CDT, co-supervised by Prof Thomas Gorochowski and Prof Claire Grierson at the University of Bristol. My project aims to design mathematical models of cell burden and evolution to provide a computational testbed for circuit design for the Engineering Biology community in order to select the best design for their projects. If anything I said is interesting, feel free to send me an email and let's chat!
