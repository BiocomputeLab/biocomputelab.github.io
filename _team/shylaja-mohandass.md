My research journey has centered on the world of cyanobacteria, a versatile photosynthetic prokaryote that thrive in a range of environments and are widely exploited for their numerous biotechnological applications. During my Ph.D., I explored these organisms by investigating their degradation and adaptation strategies in response to heavy metals and pollutants by employing genetic manipulation to uncover their mechanisms and functions. At Queen Mary University, my postdoctoral work focused on cyanobacterial phototaxis, its real-time dynamics and flocculation mechanisms through confocal microscopy, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Now, at the University of Bristol, I will join the CYBER team, where our mission is to reprogram cyanobacteria for cutting-edge environmental applications.
