I am a 2nd year master student from Hamburg, Germany, visiting the lab for a research project on eToeholds in plants. I am trying to build and test eToehold switches for tobacco. I learned about synthetic biology through iGEM in 2019 where we also worked with toehold switches, though in bacteria. This year I am participating in iGEM again with the iGEM Team Uni-Hamburg, where we use split-ribozymes to detect bacterial RNA.
