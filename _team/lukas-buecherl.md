Lukas Buecherl is a 4th year Ph.D. student visiting the lab for a research project related to genetic circuit design. In 2020, he joined the Genetic Logic Lab under the supervision of Dr. Chris Myers at the University of Colorado Boulder. He is a member of the IQ Biology program and his research focuses on synthetic biology, especially the prediction of genetic circuit behavior in silico.

Throughout his Ph.D., he has worked on different synthetic biology software tools including iBioSim, SBOLCanvas, SynBioSuite, and SynBioHub. His main focus, however, is on analyzing the behavior of genetic circuits using stochastic simulation methods like Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm and stochastic model checking.
