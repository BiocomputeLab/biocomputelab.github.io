I'm a sophomore at Stanford University majoring in Biomedical Computation, and potentially coterming in Computer Science. My primary interest lies in using computation and visualization of computer programming to solve challenges in precision health. My project is about rendering complex genetic design with dnaplotlib for a beautiful visualization of genetic circuit.
