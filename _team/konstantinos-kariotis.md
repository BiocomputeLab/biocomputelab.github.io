I am a summer intern in the Biocompute Lab, supervised by Prof. Thomas Gorochowski and Thea Irvine. My project focuses on enabling highly multiplexed gene editing using CRISPR-associated transposon (CAST) systems, specifically type I-F CASTs (INTEGRATE). I developed a computational tool to generate functional, diversified scaffold variants designed to minimize homologous recombination, and I am currently testing their editing efficiency in vivo. I am particularly interested in the intersection of synthetic and generative biology and am excited by its potential to drive translational research and enable impactful therapeutic and biotechnological innovations.
