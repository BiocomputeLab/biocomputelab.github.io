I am currently working at the interface of experimental and computational biology to understand the interactions between synthetic gene circuits and host microorganisms at the molecular level. Alongside my PhD I maintain an interest in responsible innovation and currently fulfil the role of president at SynBio UK, an association connecting synthetic biology students across the UK.
