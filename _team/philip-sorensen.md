PhD student working on developing orthogonal translation systems to determine the design rules governing the function of ribosomes. 
 
Professional interests outside of synthetic biology include biosecurity, where I’m currently a member of the Biosafety and Biosecurity committee for the international iGEM competition.
    
I am a big advocate for the accessibility of synthetic biology, which is why I am a part of the organising committee for the international GOGEC competition: A competition that aims to provide an open space for university students to present their synthetic biology related work to the rest of the world - without being limited by having to pay participation fees.
