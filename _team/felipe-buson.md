I'm a PhD student on the BBSRC/EPSRC Engineering Biology CDT. With my project I intend to expand the limits for robustness in biocomputation, making sure that genetic circuits work in diverse contexts. In a more general sense, I'm interested in the rational engineering of regulatory networks, standardization of synthetic biology designs and analytics, and laboratory automation. I believe that by developing better tools for bioengineers, I will accelerate our path towards having full control over living systems.
