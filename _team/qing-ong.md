I am a PhD student in the Bristol-Macquarie Cotutelle Programme, co-supervised by Prof Thomas Gorochowski at University of Bristol and Dr Briardo Llorente at Macquarie University, Australia. My project aims to create synthetic neo-chromosomes for gene regulation in yeast that are able to rapidly diversify their structure and function using the SCRaMbLE system. My general research interest lies in bridging synthetic biology and real-world applications, and I look forward to working on this in the future.
