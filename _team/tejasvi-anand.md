I graduated from the University of Bristol in 2022 with a BSc in Biomedical Science. During this time I developed a keen interest in cellular and molecular biochemistry which was further fueled by an internship at Zumutor Biologics where we aimed to identify novel immunotherapies using monoclonal antibodies from a human antibody gene library.

My interdisciplinary PhD project, supervised by Prof. Mark Szczelkun and Dr. Thomas Gorochowski aims to understand the molecular mechanisms behind a type of phase variation used by certain bacterial Type I Restriction-Modification enzymes called “shufflons”. These systems use genetic recombination as a tool to subvert phage epidemics and modify global gene expression. These are improtant topics to explore in the context of rising antibiotic resistance and in novel treatment strategies such as phage therapy. I will explore the frequency of recombination and it's triggers using in-vitro and in-vivo assays and investigate the potential of shuffling as a basis for the rational design of genetic switches.
