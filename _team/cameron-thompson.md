I am an MRes Synthetic Gene Circuitry student at the University of Bristol. My aim is to test the viability of a novel class of reporter proteins for use in the debugging of synthetic genetic circuits.

My Ph.D. is a part of the SynCrop project (Synthetic Circuits for Robust Orthogonal Production). My project is focused on the development of modular synthetic genetic circuits for the production of compounds of industrial interest. I aim to develop a toolkit of sensors and degradation machinery to enable the control of metabolic pathways. In addition, I will use mathematical modelling to better understand the target levels of protein that optimise production and yields.
